## Prerequisites 

To participate in the summer school students need to master the **basics in statics and dynamics**.

English Level B2 is compulsory.

## Program structure 
The topic of the summer school is **Mechanisms in mechatronics**.

Mechanisms are mechanical devices that transfer force and motion from a source to an output. The summer school will cover these concepts in its application to mechatronics systems.
Learning Outcome of the summer school:
-Kinematic analysis and synthesis theory in a design context,
-Apply graphical and analytical methods to analyze and design mechanisms tocreate arbitrary motion,
-Use software tools for detailed linkage synthesis
-Design and construct a working mechanism in small teams.

The University of Minnesota has a particular expertise in this field and one of the world leading scientists, [**Prof. Arthur Erdman**](https://cse.umn.edu/me/arthur-erdman), still teaches at UMinnesota and might contribute to the programme.

The detailed programme will be developed after sufficient students have registered and the summer school can be conducted. 

An outline of the programme structure can be found in this ppt presentation, put together by Prof. Julianna Abel.
