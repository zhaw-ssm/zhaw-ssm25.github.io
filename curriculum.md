## Prerequisites 

To participate in the summer school students need to master the **basics in statics and dynamics**.

English Level B2 is compulsory.

## Program structure 
The topic of teh summer school of **Mechanisms in mechatronics**.

Mechanisms are mechanical devices that transfer force and motion from a source to an output. The summer school will cover these concepts in its application to mechatronics systems.
Learning Outcome of the summer school:
-Kinematic analysis and synthesis theory in a design context,
-Apply graphical and analytical methods to analyze and design mechanisms tocreate arbitrary motion,
-Use software tools for detailed linkage synthesis
-Design and construct a working mechanism in small teams.

The University of Minnesota has a particular expertise in this field and one of the world leading scientists, Prof. Arthur Erdman, still teaches at UMinnesota and might contribute to the programme.
