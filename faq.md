# Logistical Questions
*Where will the students be staying?*

The students will be staying at a hotel on campus of the [University of Minnesota, Twin City](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/about-us). The campus facilities are closed during the time period of the summer school in August and therefore, student dorms cannot be used. Once the exact hotel is identified, it will be updated on this webpage.

*Where will the students get their meals?*

As the campus facilities are closed, students need to buy their own food in shops and restaurants nearby. Most probably, the lunch will be provided during lunch breaks, but breakfast and dinner need be bought individually.

*How is the flight booking handled?*

ZHAW students need to book and pay the return flight to Minneapolis, Minnesota by themselves. Please wait for flight bookings until the organizers have confirmed the conduction of summer school 2025, which will be communicated in February 2025.

*Do I need to travel back to Switzerland straight after the summer school, or is there an option to extend the stay in the USA and travel back later?*

Yes, you can extend your stay and continue with your vacation or other travels, back-to-back to the summer school.

*Is it compulsory to participate in the weekend activities/excursions?*

Yes, this is an integral part of the curriculum and team building activities.
